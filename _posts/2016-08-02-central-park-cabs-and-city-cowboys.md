# Central Park, Cabs and City Cowboys

### How to find your way through a 4 day weekend in Manhattan

> When you leave New York, you really notice how quiet and relativly sane most other major cities are.

The second you step off the bus or out of the Subway which brought you from what ever place you came from, it always takes a few minutes to gather your senses. To try and think with all the car horns, screeching and just loud constant noise. Not just any noise, but noise that is unique to New York. Late on Thursday afternoon, we stepped out of Penn Street Station with a 20 minute walk with out backpacks to find our AirBnB Apartment and hoping that it holds up to our relativly low expectations; It has Wifi, Beds a shower and most importantly, as promised, close to Times Square.

Accidently we found ourselves to be in New York for the NYC Pride Parade, we found ourselves a good spot by the famous Flatiron Building
